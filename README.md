npm-cachify -- A caching utility for npm.
==============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chaddotson/npm-cachify.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chaddotson/npm-cachify)


This package will download an npm package and all its dependencies into the cache of your choice.

I would classify it as alpha quality.  It works, but it doesn't handle failures all that well at the time being.  Its been a work in progress that I don't get to that often.
